### Overview
Head of the Navy and leader of [[World/Grimtol/Ockport\|Ockport]]. He sits on the [[World/Grimtol/Kings Council\|Kings Council]]. 

Mindartis has been the head of the navy for around 200 years. He is the only Naval Captain most people have known. He is rather eccentric and unpredictable. He has been alive for so long that things just get too boring for him, so he likes to shake things up by causing trouble here and there, especially for the other Councilors. He is known to make up rumors and myths just for the fun of it.
