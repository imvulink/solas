### Overview
  
Velcria grew up on the streets with some other children. They formed their own gang, but over the years they have all lost touch. She has always been a trouble maker, causing fights and chaos wherever she goes. She finds peace and calm just too boring. She became a drunkard and learned how to fight through many many bar fights. Now she stays at the adventures guild because it gives her a roof over her head, money in her pockets, and people to beat up.
