### Overview
He was the missing princess personal guard. He was dismissed after she went missing, being blamed for incompetence. He had a sleeping spell cast on him when the princess went missing, leading many to believe she was kidnapped. The only reason he was not killed was due to his many years of service to the crown and his many medals and honors awarded to him. Hating that the princess may be in danger he as dedicated his life to searching for her. Being outcast from the guards as a failure, his only way to continue his search with help was to join the adventurers guild. However he has made very little progress, almost like someone is working to keep him off the trail.
