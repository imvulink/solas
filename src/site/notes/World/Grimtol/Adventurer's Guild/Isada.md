### Overview
She grew up living on the streets, needing to steal her next meal to make it by. She is self taught on archery and learned how to hunt, deciding it was better to live out in the woods in nature, than to live on the streets. [[World/Grimtol/Adventurer's Guild/Mystra\|Mystra]] found her injured in a cave from a pack of wolves attacking her, claiming she was guided there by her sight. [[World/Grimtol/Adventurer's Guild/Mystra\|Mystra]] healed her up and brought her to the guild, where Isada decided to join since it meant a roof over her head and food in her belly. Since then she has become a rather skilled adventurer, being most useful when it comes to tracking down monsters in the wild.
