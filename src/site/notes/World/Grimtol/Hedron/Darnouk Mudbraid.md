### Overview
Leader of [[World/Grimtol/Hedron/Hedron\|Hedron]] and sits on the [[World/Grimtol/Kings Council\|Kings Council]] to represent [[World/Grimtol/Hedron/Hedron\|Hedron]].
Darnouk is an older dwarf who has lived his whole life in Hedron. Rarely ever leaving to travel. He is currently the oldest member of their community. He treats everyone in Hedron like his family and would do anything to protect them and their livelihoods. He has a heart of gold and most people consider him to be like a grandfather. Due to his old age he has many stories and traditions to share with the younger generations. He is a staple of their community and is beloved by everyone in Hedron. He inspires a community that works together to put food on everyone's table and does his best to take care of his people despite their lack of wealth and sometimes food. He believes in fairness and equality, which is why he butts heads with many of the other councilors, aside from [[World/Grimtol/Salmyre/Roland Duran\|Roland Duran]], who he views as his only real ally amongst them.
