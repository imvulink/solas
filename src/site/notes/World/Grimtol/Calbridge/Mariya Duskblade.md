### Overview

Head of the Army and is in charge of [[World/Grimtol/Calbridge/Calbridge\|Calbridge]]. She also sits on the [[World/Grimtol/Kings Council\|Kings Council]].

Mariya grew up in a military family. Her father was head of the army until he retired 10 years ago and she took over. Her family has very close ties with the royal family and is endlessly loyal to the king. Mariya will always side with what the king wants, even if she feels it is wrong. She believes that his word is final. All actions she makes are for the benefit of the king and Grimtol. She is ruthless when it comes to training the army and believes that only the best of the best should be allowed to stay. Due to this the army of Grimtol is rather small, but do not underestimate its might. Due to her strict military upbringing and characteristics she is constantly butting heads with the head of the Navy, [[World/Grimtol/Ockport/Mindartis Abize\|Mindartis Abize]]. Causing a large rift between the Army and Navy, making them rarely agree on much.
