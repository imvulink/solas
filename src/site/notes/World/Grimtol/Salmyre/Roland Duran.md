### Overview
Mayor of [[World/Grimtol/Salmyre/Salmyre\|Salmyre]] and sits on the [[World/Grimtol/Kings Council\|Kings Council]] to represent [[World/Grimtol/Salmyre/Salmyre\|Salmyre]].
Roland was the former leader of the Adventurer's Guild. He retired due to the offer from the King to become a councilor. Unlike most of the council he earned his place there, rather than buying it or being born into it. The only person he consideres an ally there is [[World/Grimtol/Hedron/Darnouk Mudbraid\|Darnouk Mudbraid]]. He left the guild in the hands of his trusted adventuring partner over the last year, and his best friend   [[World/Grimtol/Adventurer's Guild/Evar Moore\|Evar Moore]]. During his time as the leader of the [[World/Grimtol/Adventurer's Guild/Adventurer's Guild\|Adventurer's Guild]] he became renowned throughout [[World/Grimtol/Grimtol\|Grimtol]] for his kind heart and knack for justice. He has always offered his help were he can, usually for nothing in return. He tries to inspire a community of adventure and curiosity, as well as encouraging trade. Most of the people in [[World/Grimtol/Salmyre/Salmyre\|Salmyre]] view him as a hero and trust his judgement when it comes to making decisions for [[World/Grimtol/Salmyre/Salmyre\|Salmyre]] due to how just and righteous he has been in the past.
