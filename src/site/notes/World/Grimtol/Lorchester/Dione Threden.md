### Overview

Mayor of [[World/Grimtol/Lorchester/Lorchester\|Lorchester]] and sits on the [[World/Grimtol/Kings Council\|Kings Council]] to represent [[World/Grimtol/Lorchester/Lorchester\|Lorchester]].

Dione comes for a long standing noble family who has ruled over [[World/Grimtol/Lorchester/Lorchester\|Lorchester]] since its founding. She is known to be distant and cold to anyone she deems bellow her, but a kiss ass to those in power. Rumor has it that she sleeps with the King on a regular basis to gain favor with him. She is hated by the common people of [[World/Grimtol/Lorchester/Lorchester\|Lorchester]] due to her high taxes and disregard of their well being. She only cares for the sake of the nobles. Knowing she is hated she never goes anywhere without her personal bodyguards nearby. Her home is also heavily guarded, never allowing anyone in without her direct permission.
