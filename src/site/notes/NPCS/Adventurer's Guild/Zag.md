### Overview
  Zag was found in a cave. He didn't speak, only followed the group of adventures through the cave, playing music the whole time. Then he kept following them all the way back to the guild. He just hasn't left, and no one has the heart to tell him to leave when they see how happy he is when everyone listens to his music, he even does a little dance.
