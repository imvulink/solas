### Overview
  Evar was born into a noble family living in Grimtol City. He was always a bit of a playboy and trouble maker. However, after the Princess went missing Evar was disowned by his family and left with nothing. It is not known why he was disowned around the time when the princess went missing, and he refuses to speak on it. Evar is always seen wearing over the top flashy clothing, like he is trying to regain his former noble status, or just fault who he used to be. However, no one seems to know him from the time before he joined the Adventures guild. He spent the last few years working his way up the ranks and has taken over as the Guild Master after the former one. [[World/Grimtol/Salmyre/Roland Duran\|Roland Duran]], had gifted him the position due to their close friendship and trust.
