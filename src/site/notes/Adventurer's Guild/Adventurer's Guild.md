### Overview
The pride of Salmyre, the [[Adventurer's Guild/Adventurer's Guild\|Adventurer's Guild]]. Inside, its walls are adorned with maps, trophies, and artifacts from daring quests. The guild is a hub of activity, where adventurers convene to accept missions, swap stories, and hone their skills. There is a board inside where anyone can post missions, quests, or jobs that they require adventurers for.
The second story houses some of the guilds members in modest rooms, allowing them to live there and have a place to call home.
