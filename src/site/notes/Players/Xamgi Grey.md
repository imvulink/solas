### Backstory
Born under a celestial omen, Xamgi Grey grew up in the quiet embrace of her mother, Nara Grey, a humble farmer, and her father, Anyim Grey, a criminal with a silver tongue but a warm heart. Though her father’s dealings were shadowed in secrecy, he was fiercely protective, teaching her how to read people and trust her instincts. Her mother, deeply devoted to the gods, raised her in faith, believing that divine purpose would one day guide her. But destiny had different plans. Her father was imprisoned, the reason unclear. Rumors whispered of betrayal, of debts unpaid, of enemies unseen. Before she could find the truth, her mother vanished without a trace. No body. No farewell. No explanation. Just… gone. With her world shattered, Xamgi took solace in the temple, becoming an acolyte. The gods, she believed, would grant her the wisdom to understand her mother’s disappearance and her father’s fate. She spent years in prayer, in study, in unwavering devotion. Until she found the tome. It was buried deep in the temple’s archives, forgotten, or perhaps hidden. The pages shifted beneath her fingers, whispers curling from the ink like smoke. As she read, the air grew heavy, electric, her vision blurred, and then— It came. A presence, ancient and vast, outside time, outside reason. A Great Old One. It did not offer comfort. It did not demand worship. It simply showed her. The truth behind the gods. The unseen patterns in reality. The knowledge no mortal mind should bear. And in that moment, faith shattered. She left the temple that night, no longer an acolyte, but something else. A seeker. A warlock. A servant of the unknown. The gods had never answered her, but this being did. Now, Xamgi walks the world chasing the mysteries—of her mother’s disappearance, her father’s imprisonment, and the whispers that never leave her mind. She knows she is being guided. She just doesn’t know where. And one day, her Patron will call upon her to pay the price.
