### Backstory
Belic’s origins are unknown, even among the Unseelie. Some whisper that he was once Seelie, a noble prince cast into darkness for breaking an ancient vow. Others claim he was never born but manifested from nature and chaos—an entity given form just because it could. What is known is this: wherever he walks, chaos follows. Rivers turn cold, shadows darken and stretch, and flowers bloom in unnatural hues. Legends speak of him first appearing at the edge of Lunar Lake, whispering invitations to those who stand alone. If one accepts, they vanish—claimed by the water, never to be seen again. But one day, he had been betrayed by both the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, and Belic was cast from their realms and into the mortal world. The Courts, fearful of his chaotic nature, manipulated him into surrendering most of his power, promising him control only to strip him of most of his abilities. With his wings reduced to mere shadows and crow feathers, he was exiled to a broken and enraged force, now nearly powerless and displaced. With its rigid time and order, the mortal realm was alien to him due to his ageless life, yet it became his new stage. As an adventurer for the Adventurers Guild, Belic navigates this world with a calm, unsettling presence, not driven by a desire for glory or wealth but by the need to reclaim what was taken from him. His hatred for the Courts runs deep, and in the mortal realm, he finds a bitter freedom—a place where chaos still calls to him, though he no longer answers to the dictates of the Courts. It is said that if you find a single black flower blooming in an unexpected place, Belic has passed through. If you pluck it, he will come for you. All who see him leave changed—or do not leave at all. He isn’t the storm but the swell of waves that crash to the shore. He isn’t the flood he is the dame that caused it. He is the whisper in the snow, telling you to fall asleep, the flicker of movement in the mist on a foggy night. And he is watching. And waiting.
