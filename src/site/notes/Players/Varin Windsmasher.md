### Backstory
Varin was born in a hidden Goliath village in the icy mountains near Calbridge, in the southern region of Lunar Lake. The village, built into the mountainside, was known for its warrior heritage, harsh survivalist culture, and deep spiritual connection to the land. Goliaths here lived by strict laws of honor, strength, and leadership—only the strongest and most capable were allowed to lead. Despite not being born into the ruling bloodline, Varin was named heir to the chiefdom due to his unparalleled strength, discipline, and combat skills. He surpassed even the chief’s son, who, by all rights, should have inherited the position. This decision caused tension among the village elites, but none could deny Varin’s power and tactical mind. He served as a high-class temple guard, protecting the sacred grounds where the spirits of fallen warriors were honored. He carried his duty with pride, devoted to his people, their traditions, and his destiny as their future leader. But all of that was stolen from him. One fateful night, an elven woman approached Varin at the temple gates. She was ethereal, beautiful, and spoke in riddles, weaving a story of destiny, power, and a hidden truth only he could uncover. Against his better judgment, he followed her from his post—a moment of weakness. When he returned, the village was in chaos. Half of his people lay dead, their bodies frozen in the snow, their blood staining the sacred grounds. Fires raged, and the enemy had already disappeared into the night. He had failed. The shame was unbearable. He had abandoned his duty and fallen for a deception, and the price was the massacre of his kin. But his punishment was not only social—it was supernatural. During the chaos, something awakened inside him. A force buried deep within his soul erupted—wild, untamed, uncontrollable magic. It surged through his body, manifesting in unpredictable bursts of raw elemental energy. He lashed out in grief and rage, but his power was unstable. Some of his people were caught in its wake. The survivors, once his brothers and sisters, now feared him as much as they hated him. They called him cursed, a harbinger of destruction, an outcast unworthy of leadership. Once destined to be the greatest leader of his people, Varin was now nothing more than a disgraced warrior with a wild, uncontrollable force inside him.
